# KNN-Titanic-Naive-Bayes-Spam-Project


For project 1 we use K_NN Classification algorithm to predict whether a passenger aboard the titanic survived or not.
## Metrics of Success

We use AUC_ROC Score, confusion matrix and classification report as the metrics for testing perfomance of our models.
## Understanding the context

The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after it collided with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. This unfortunate incident resulted in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. In this analysis we will explore the data to understand which group of people had a better chance at surviving and then later build a model to predict what sorts of people were more likely to survive using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
# project 2 - Email classification

We use Naive Bayes Classifier to filter spam messages from non spam messages
Metrics of Success

## Metric for success
We use AUC_ROC Score, confusion matrix and classification report as the metrics for testing perfomance of our models.
Understanding the context

## Understanding the context
Nowadays, e-mail provides many ways to send millions of advertisement at no cost to sender. As a result, many unsolicited bulk e-mail, also known as spam e-mail spread widely and become serious threat to not only the Internet but also to society. For example, when user received large amount of e-mail spam, the chance of the user forgot to read a non-spam message increase. As a result, many e-mail readers have to spend their time removing unwanted messages. E-mail spam also may cost money to users with dial-up connections, waste bandwidth, and may expose minors to unsuitable content. Over the past many years, many approaches have been provided to block e-mail spam. We will use Na¨ıve Bayes algorithm to create a model that acurately filters spam emails from non spam emails and classifiesthem accordingly.
